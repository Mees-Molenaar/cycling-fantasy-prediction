## Introduction

Every year, I compete in a cycling fantasy league for the legendary Tour de France. Last year, I have learned Machine Learning and I think the best learning experience comes from making a project. Therefore, I embarked on this fun project to test what I have learned and to develop me further. 

Steps taken in this project:
* Web scraping to acquire the data
* Filling missing data with image classification
* Engineering features
* Training and using a machine learning model
